/**
 * The recommended way is to treat the Web service data model as
 * being distinct from the appâ€™s data model, with conversions between them as needed.
 * This is similar to how we have our Room entities defined separately from our
 * models, so any changes in Room do not affect our core app logic. We
 * are going to funnel our server responses into the database, so we will be converting Web service
 * responses into entities that we can attempt to insert into the database. (p. 527)
